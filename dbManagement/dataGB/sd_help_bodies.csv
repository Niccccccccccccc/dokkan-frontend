To engage in a battle, deploy any number of 
your Sticker Cards to confront an enemy 
Sticker Card that appears on the battlefield. 

You do not need to defeat the enemy in one go. 
If a battle ends before you win, the enemy's status 
will be carried over into your next attempt. 

Battles can be continued at a later time as follows: 
- If you retire from a battle you have started. 
- If you lose a battle. 
{color : #FFFF00}* Note that if you return to the map from a battlefield, 
you will not be able to return to that same battle again. {color} 

{size: 24}{outline: #FF0000, 2}{color: #FFFF00}= How to Engage in Battles ={outline}{color}{size} 
Up to 5 Sticker Cards can be deployed in a single stage at 
a time. Sticker Cards used in a battle will disappear when 
the battle ends, regardless of whether you win or lose. 
During a battle, Sticker Cards that have finished 
their attack will be grayed out.",2024-07-24 07:36:37.283774,2024-07-24 07:36:37.283774

will remain in the state they were in from the last battle. 
You can view the remaining time of a battle from the 
battlefield screen or the battle details screen. 

There are four enemy difficulties: 
SUPER, Z-HARD, HARD and NORMAL. 
Enemy strength varies by difficulty, so keep this 
in mind before engaging in a battle. Enemy HP, 
the sum of each enemy Sticker Card's HP, 
will be displayed on the bar located at the top.
