        Settings Object & LWF Loading:
        The settings object contains all the parameters required to load the LWF file.
        It is defined first so that the resource loading is initiated immediately.
         
        - lwf: Path to the LWF file.
        - stage: The canvas element where the animation will be rendered.
        - imageMap: The function mapping asset names to their full URLs.
        - setBackgroundColor: 'FF000000' sets the background to fully opaque black.
        - additionalParams: Configuration for alpha blending.
        - onload: Callback function executed when the LWF file is loaded.
                         It stores the loaded LWF in a global variable, attaches the desired scene,
                         scales the animation to fit the canvas, activates it, and starts the animation loop.

        It does so by extracting the directory portion from the lwfUrl and appending the asset name.
        This ensures that the associated asset files, which are typically located alongside the LWF file,
        are loaded from the correct location.

        Animation Loop using requestAnimationFrame:
 
        requestAnimationFrame is a browser API that synchronizes the animation loop with the
        browser's repaint cycle. It provides a more efficient and smoother animation than 
        alternatives like setTimeout or setInterval.
         
        How it works:
        - The render function is defined to update (exec) and render the animation.
        - The first call to requestAnimationFrame (outside the render function) initiates the process.
        - Inside the render function, requestAnimationFrame is called again to schedule the next frame.
        This recursive call ensures the render continues running.
         
        Note: It might seem like requestAnimationFrame is "called twice" because it is called both 
        to start the render and then again within the render to maintain continuous animation.
    */
    function startAnimation(lwf) {
        let lastTime = performance.now(); // Capture the starting time
 
        // Define the render function that updates and renders the animation on each frame.
        function render(currentTime) {
            if (lwf && lwf.active) {
                // Calculate the elapsed time (delta) in seconds since the last frame
                const deltaTime = (currentTime - lastTime) / 1000;
                lastTime = currentTime;
                // Update the animation state based on the time elapsed
                lwf.exec(deltaTime);
                // Render the current frame of the animation onto the canvas
                lwf.render();
            }
            // Request the next animation frame. This recursive call keeps the loop running.
            requestAnimationFrame(render);
        }
         
        // Start the animation loop by requesting the first frame.
